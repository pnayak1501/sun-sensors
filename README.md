# sun-sensors

OBC(On Board Computer) primarily consists of microprocessors and interfacing chips, whose role is to connect computers with other subsystems. Microprocessor is interfaced with various sensors for the proper working of the spacecraft. The main goal is to build one of the sensors, that is, the analog sun sensors. Its role is to deliver the coarse information about the position of the sun relative to the spacecraft by continually viewing the sun from the orbiting body and generate electrical signals which provide the voltage of the orbiting body's position. It indicates the angle of the sun by continuous output, which is expressed in terms of voltage based on the position of the sun, and the same would be transmitted to the spacecraft computer(OBC).This problem can be solved with the help of  Verilog (HDL).
